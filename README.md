# Accessible Code
A working example of using acceptable contrast ratios in code snippets for use in Jekyll.  Every web platform has a slightly different way of detecting and styling code.  This is not a universal solution, but hopefully an encouragement for you to check to see if your code coloring theme uses a contrast ratio that meets modern accessibility standards.

## Resources
For more information on the types of needs associated with visual accessibility, you [learn more about colorblindness here](http://webaim.org/articles/visual/colorblind).  Or you can [test your color palate here](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to see if it meets the standards.

## How It Works
I built my code coloring theme on top of a Jekyll template, so simply copying and pasting these colors won't fix it (unless you're building a Jekyll site on top of the Minima theme).  But you can take a look at what I did in order to make decisions about what might work for you.
